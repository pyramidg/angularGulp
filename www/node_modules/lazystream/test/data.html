<p>Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to
look forward to, I&#39;m quite dizzy with anticipation . . . Or is it the wind?</p>
<p>There really is a lot of that now, isn&#39;t there? And wow! Hey! What&#39;s this thing
suddenly coming toward me very fast? Very, very fast. So big and flat and round,
it needs a big wide-sounding name like . . . ow . . . ound . . . round . . .
ground! That&#39;s it! That&#39;s a good name- ground!</p>
<p>I wonder if it will be friends with me?</p>
<p>Hello Ground!</p>

<p>And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.</p>
